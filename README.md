# Your-Archive
Your Archive is a personalized website where you can make use of storing personal items.
These items can be images, documents, projects, folders and many more.
The items you store in your personal storage can be retrieved and any time when you are logged in.
The items can be shared with other users who make use of the website. 
This allows teams to make use of the same items.

There is an agenda which you can use to note important meetings, deadlines or even a birthday of one of your relatives.
You can use a reminder which allows us to use your email and give you a reminder for that day with
the information you have given for that date.
